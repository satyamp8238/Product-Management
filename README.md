 Web API Layer (ProductCategory.API)
ProductsController
‚Ä¢	CRUD Endpoints:
‚Ä¢	GET /api/products: Supports pagination, returns total count and total pages.
‚Ä¢	GET /api/products/{id}: Returns product by ID, 404 if not found.
‚Ä¢	POST /api/products: Adds a product, validates category existence and model state.
‚Ä¢	PUT /api/products/{id}: Updates a product, checks for ID match, existence, and category validity.
‚Ä¢	DELETE /api/products/{id}: Deletes a product, 404 if not found.
‚Ä¢	Validation:
‚Ä¢	Uses ModelState.IsValid for DTOs.
‚Ä¢	Checks for valid category before add/update.
‚Ä¢	Error Handling:
‚Ä¢	Returns appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.
CategoriesController
‚Ä¢	CRUD Endpoints:
‚Ä¢	GET /api/categories: Returns all categories.
‚Ä¢	GET /api/categories/{id}: Returns category by ID, 404 if not found.
‚Ä¢	POST /api/categories: Adds a category, generates new GUID.
‚Ä¢	PUT /api/categories/{id}: Updates a category, checks for ID match.
‚Ä¢	DELETE /api/categories/{id}: Deletes a category if not in use.
‚Ä¢	Validation & Error Handling:
‚Ä¢	Checks for category-in-use before delete.
‚Ä¢	Returns clear status and messages.
API Project Setup
‚Ä¢	Swagger: Enabled in development for API testing.
‚Ä¢	Dependency Injection: Repositories and DbContext are registered.
‚Ä¢	HTTPS: Enforced.
‚Ä¢	Authorization: Middleware is present (though no policies are shown).
---
2. UI Layer (ProductCategory.UI)
Services
‚Ä¢	ProductService & CategoryService:
‚Ä¢	Use HttpClientFactory with a named client for API calls.
‚Ä¢	Implement async CRUD methods.
‚Ä¢	Handle API responses and errors robustly.
Controllers
‚Ä¢	ProductController & CategoryController:
‚Ä¢	Use services to interact with the API.
‚Ä¢	Validate model state before processing.
‚Ä¢	Return JSON responses for AJAX calls.
‚Ä¢	Support pagination and view models for listing.
Program.cs
‚Ä¢	Service Registration:
‚Ä¢	Registers services and HTTP client.
‚Ä¢	Configures JSON options for property naming.
‚Ä¢	Routing:
‚Ä¢	Sets up default controller route.
---
3. Microservices Considerations
‚Ä¢	Separation:
‚Ä¢	API and UI are in separate projects, a good step toward microservices.
‚Ä¢	Communication:
‚Ä¢	UI communicates with API via HTTP, not direct DB access.
‚Ä¢	Scalability:
‚Ä¢	Each service can be deployed/scaled independently.
‚Ä¢	Extensibility:
‚Ä¢	Easy to add more services (e.g., authentication, reporting) as separate APIs.
---
4. Recommendations
‚Ä¢	DTO Consistency:
‚Ä¢	Ensure all DTOs have validation attributes.
‚Ä¢	Error Logging:
‚Ä¢	Add logging for exceptions in API controllers.
‚Ä¢	Response Consistency:
‚Ä¢	Standardize API responses (e.g., always return a consistent envelope).
‚Ä¢	Security:
‚Ä¢	Implement authentication/authorization as needed.
‚Ä¢	Testing:
‚Ä¢	Add unit and integration tests for controllers and services.
